# Networking Basics

## Description:

This project delves into fundamental networking concepts for beginners, providing clear explanation of:
* Localhost(127.0.0.1) - A special IP address that refers to your own computer, acting as a loopback mechanism for testing and development.
* 0.0.0.0 - A placeholder address used in various contexts, often signifying an unspecified target, listening on all interfaces, or a default route.
* /etc/hosts - A system file that maps hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses, allowing for custom hostname resolution.
* Displaying Active Network Interfaces - How to view the network interfaces currently in use on your machine, useful for configuration and troubleshooting.
